# MMA SCRAPING :martial_arts_uniform: :boxing_glove:

### A simple web scraping project to get the latest information on MMA fights and fighters. This is the scraping data portion of some larger projects

Currently, this is being utilized in two other projects:

- An [mma-api](https://github.com/danetsao/mma-api).

- A python package [PyFighter](https://github.com/danetsao/pyfighter) for mma athlete data.

Feel free to use this data for your own projects. I will try to keep this updated as much as possible and feel free to contribute and suggest changes.
